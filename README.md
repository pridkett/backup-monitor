Overview
--------

This is a small little program that I built to run on my Synology NAS to monitor the creation of backups from other machines that are stored on the NAS. Using this you can define a simple set of rules to check and then it will check those rules and report back to see if the backups have been recently created.

The primary use is to have [Uptime Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/) raise issues if the backups are not being created properly.
